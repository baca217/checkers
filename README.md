Object-Oriented Project 6 Final Project (Checkers)  
By: Elmer Baca Holguin and Timothy Euken
=======================
This project is meant our knowledge and understanding of object oriented topics by applying some patterns to our own project.  
This project used a game state pattern to keep track of tile pieces, aggregation for tracking pieces on each tile, and a composition
relationship for 64 tiles that the CheckersApp class needs in order to work.
